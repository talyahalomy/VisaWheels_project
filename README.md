# Welcome to my VisaWheels project!

In my python session at sela college, when we learned about fast api I wanted to take it few steps further, and implement that 
idea, from python code all the way for running and ready application in kubernetes.

# VisaWheels Application

A single application composed of two FastAPI services integrated with MongoDB. The Main Service handles vehicles data management and transaction initiation, while the Visa Service processes transactions, generates status responses (success/failure).
Both vehicles and transactions are stored in Mongo databases, which we can use to store a new data, and retrieval of data as needed.
